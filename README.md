# Next.js App Router

An intuitive and flexible routing system for Next.js applications. The App Router leverages Next.js's file-based routing to streamline the process of creating dynamic and nested routes, making it easier to build scalable web applications.

## Features

- **File-based Routing**: Create routes simply by adding files in the `pages` directory.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Support for dynamic parameters in URLs.
- **API Routes**: Seamlessly create backend APIs with file-based routing.
- **Nested Routes**: Organize and manage nested routes easily.
- **Built-in Middleware**: Use middleware to handle authentication, logging, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Next.js App Router, create a new Next.js project or use an existing one:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
cd my-app
```
